This repository collects the data used and generated for the paper named: _Bidirectional Model Transformations of City Spaces for the Design and Operation of Adaptive Systems_.
For actual use of these models refer to [topocity][4e32e58b].

Each directory contains the data models for one of the case studies from the paper. Files are organized this way:

- _original.gml_ contains the original source model used.
- _ade.gml_ contains the Application Domain Extension information.
- _view.big_ contains the graph generated by the __get__ transformation
- _out.gml_ contains the new source model generated by the __put__ transformation.

## Scenario 1: Facilitating System Design - Tower Crane Positioning
Original model comes from: [Remscheid LOD1 CityGML Model][74557c32], file *LoD1_369_5668_1_NW.gml*.



##  Scenario 2: Facilitating System Operation - Emergency Response.
Original model comes from: [New York - TUM - Flat Iron Street][fa27df69].
